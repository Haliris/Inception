Thanks for clarifying! Let's review your **WordPress Dockerfile** and ensure everything is set up correctly.

### Analysis of the Current `Dockerfile`:
1. **Base Image**:
   - You're using `debian:bullseye` as the base image, which is fine for a custom setup. However, many official Docker images (like `wordpress:php-fpm`) are already optimized for running WordPress, so it might be worth considering whether you need a custom image or can use an existing one.
   
2. **Installing Dependencies**:
   - You're installing various tools like `wget`, `net-tools`, PHP, MariaDB client, etc. These are useful for setting up WordPress, but let's ensure they are necessary. Specifically, the `net-tools` package might not be essential for a basic WordPress setup unless you have a specific need for networking utilities inside the container.
   - **Suggestion**: If you're only using the container to run WordPress and its related PHP-FPM service, you can likely omit the MariaDB client (`mariadb-client`) from this image. Instead, you'd typically interact with a separate MariaDB container (via Docker Compose).

3. **Installing PHP and PHP-FPM**:
   - The PHP installation and PHP-FPM setup (`sed` command to change `listen` from the socket to an open port `9000`) look fine for a basic WordPress setup.
   - **Suggestion**: Ensure you're using the required version of PHP (`7.4` in this case). WordPress 6.0 should work with PHP 7.4, but if you're using a newer version of WordPress, you might want to check compatibility with newer PHP versions (e.g., PHP 8.0+).

4. **Downloading WordPress**:
   - You're downloading a specific version of WordPress (`6.0-fr_FR.tar.gz`), extracting it, and moving the files to `/var/www/wordpress`.
   - **Suggestion**: If you're not specifically targeting WordPress 6.0 in French, you might want to download the latest version or use an official WordPress image instead, which typically downloads the latest stable release.
   - Ensure that `/var/www/wordpress` is the correct directory. Later, you're setting `/var/www/html/wordpress` as the working directory, which might cause confusion if the paths don't align.
   
5. **Setting Permissions**:
   - You're changing ownership of `/var/www/wordpress` and `/var/www/html/wordpress` to `www-data:www-data`, which is the correct user for Nginx or Apache running WordPress.
   - **Suggestion**: The `chmod -R 777` command gives full read/write/execute permissions to all users. This is usually not recommended for production systems, as it opens up the directory to potential security risks. Instead, consider giving the directory `755` or `775` permissions (depending on the needs of the container).

6. **WP-CLI**:
   - You're downloading the WP-CLI tool (`wp-cli.phar`), which is useful for managing WordPress installations from the command line.
   - **Suggestion**: If you don't need to run WP-CLI commands manually in this container, you can skip this step. However, if you do plan to run WP-CLI commands, it looks good so far.

7. **Auto-configuration Script**:
   - You're copying a script `auto_config.sh` and setting it as the entry point. Assuming this script is where you set up the WordPress configuration (`wp-config.php`) and any necessary environment variables, this is fine.
   - **Suggestion**: Make sure that `auto_config.sh` correctly configures WordPress for your environment, including the database connection. You should also check that this script doesn't fail silently or exit prematurely. Adding debug output to the script (like `echo` statements) might help debug any issues.

8. **Exposing Port**:
   - You expose port `9000`, which is the typical port for PHP-FPM. This is correct for a container running PHP-FPM. If Nginx is running in a separate container (which it should), the two containers should be linked via a Docker network, and Nginx should forward requests to `wordpress:9000` (as specified in the Nginx configuration).

### Suggested Updates

1. **Directory Structure**:
   - There seems to be some confusion between `/var/www/wordpress` and `/var/www/html/wordpress`. If you're copying the WordPress files into `/var/www/wordpress`, you should ensure that this is the location Nginx or PHP-FPM expects.

2. **Clean Up Permissions**:
   - Avoid using `chmod -R 777` for WordPress files in the container. Use more restrictive permissions like `755` or `775` for directories and `644` for files:
     ```dockerfile
     RUN chmod -R 755 /var/www/wordpress
     RUN chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/wordpress
     ```

3. **WP-CLI**:
   - If you donâ€™t need WP-CLI in this container, remove the installation steps. Alternatively, ensure your script `auto_config.sh` makes use of `wp` for configuration tasks.

4. **Recheck WordPress Extraction Path**:
   - You extract WordPress to `/var/www/wordpress`, but later, you're working in `/var/www/html/wordpress`. Make sure that these paths align, or change the working directory to `/var/www/wordpress`.

5. **Improve Dockerfile Efficiency**:
   - You can chain the `RUN` commands to reduce the number of layers in your image:
     ```dockerfile
     RUN apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y && apt-get install -y \
         net-tools \
         wget \
         php7.4 \
         php-fpm \
         php-mysql \
         mariadb-client && \
         sed -i 's|^listen = /run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock|listen = 0.0.0.0:9000|' /etc/php/7.4/fpm/pool.d/www.conf
     ```

### Final Dockerfile (Updated)

Here's an updated version of your Dockerfile with the above suggestions:

```dockerfile
FROM debian:bullseye

# Install dependencies and PHP-FPM
RUN apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y && apt-get install -y \
    net-tools \
    wget \
    php7.4 \
    php-fpm \
    php-mysql \
    mariadb-client && \
    sed -i 's|^listen = /run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock|listen = 0.0.0.0:9000|' /etc/php/7.4/fpm/pool.d/www.conf

# Download and extract WordPress
RUN wget https://ft.wordpress.org/wordpress-6.0-fr_FR.tar.gz -P /var/www && \
    tar -xzf /var/www/wordpress-6.0-fr_FR.tar.gz -C /var/www && \
    rm /var/www/wordpress-6.0-fr_FR.tar.gz && \
    chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/wordpress

# Install WP-CLI
RUN wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wp-cli/builds/gh-pages/phar/wp-cli.phar && \
    chmod +x wp-cli.phar && \
    mv wp-cli.phar /usr/local/bin/wp

# Copy the auto-config script
COPY ./tools/auto_config.sh /usr/local/bin/auto_config.sh
RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/auto_config.sh && mkdir -p /run/php

# Expose PHP-FPM port
EXPOSE 9000

# Set the working directory and entry point
WORKDIR /var/www/wordpress
CMD exec /usr/local/bin/auto_config.sh
```

### Notes:
- **File Permissions**: The Dockerfile now ensures proper ownership and permissions for WordPress files without overexposing them.
- **Directory Structure**: Ensures `/var/www/wordpress` is correctly populated and used by the container.

### Additional Considerations:

- **Volume Mounting**: You might want to set up a volume for `/var/www/wordpress` so that your WordPress files are persistent and shared across container restarts.
- **Database Configuration**: Ensure that your `auto_config.sh` script properly configures `wp-config.php` to connect to the MariaDB container.
